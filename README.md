# pomodoro-timer-website
A website that implements a simple pomodoro timer to assist with productivity. This was made as a requirement for university. 

This was a group project, and while I made some changes to the html and css codes, my largest contribution was to the JavaScript portion. Looking back, some minor improvements could definitely have been made. Replacing "var" with "let" for the variables is one example as that would be more in line with JavaScript conventions. Another would be replacing "innerHTML" with "textContent" as the former can pose a security risk when used, even though in this code's context it would not matter.
